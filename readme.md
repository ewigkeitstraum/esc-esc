Hide, run, and escape—parkour-driven hide-and-seek experience.

**Esconde-esconde** is a Spigot-based Minecraft minigame plugin designed for version 1.8.8. It was specifically developed on this version to provide first-class support for 1.8.x players without the need for protocol converters such as ViaBackwards. A native port for 1.21.x is planned for the near future. Originally developed by [ewigkeitstraum](https://namemc.com/profile/ewigkeitstraum.1) and [zukunftshoffnung](https://namemc.com/profile/zukunftshoffnung.1) to provide a community-driven variation of the minigame. Currently closed-source, the project is planned to be fully open-source in the future—including maps, one-jump references, the plugin itself, and its dependencies.

## Roadmap

**Esconde-esconde** is currently maintained by just two anonymous developers. Because of this, some features—particularly 
those related to community support, bug tracking, and map submissions—have not yet been fully implemented.

While the long-term goal is to make the entire project open-source, including maps, configurations, technical documentation, 
and development tools, the plugin remains closed-source for now. This is simply due to the project not yet being in a stable
or well-documented enough state to support open contribution and maintenance. Once the codebase reaches a more mature stage, 
all materials will be made publicly available to foster true open-source collaboration.

Below are the development phases and what’s planned ahead:

**During alpha stage:**
- Focus on fixing all known bugs, especially those that impact performance or gameplay experience.
- Address minor and non-critical bugs to improve stability.
- Perform critical performance optimizations.

> [!NOTE]
> _Data persistence is not yet implemented, as there are plans to introduce a more complex and
> versatile statistics system in the future. This system will track precise playtime, matches
> started/won per role, scoring formulas, and weighted averages for performance analysis. Due
> to the increased modeling complexity, this feature has been deferred to the beta stage._

**During beta stage:**
- Implement essential game systems to solidify a stable foundation:
  - Data persistence
  - Game statistics system
  - Scoring formula based on player stats
- Introduce initial cosmetic systems
- Add balancing tools to support seekers in games with few hiders
- Add fast-travel and mobility systems for small maps
- Explore potential alternative modes like "rush mode" or special event-based games for smaller maps

**Long-term vision:**
- Create a public-facing dashboard to track issues, suggestions, and bug reports.
- Possibly integrate this dashboard into GitHub or an external platform.
- Fully open-source the project, including maps and dependencies.
- Expand the minigame's content with new mechanics and extensibility options for the community.
