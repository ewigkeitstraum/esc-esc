# Contributing

We appreciate your interest in contributing to **Esconde-esconde**, a community-driven hide-and-seek minigame for Minecraft (Spigot 1.8.8).

At this stage, the plugin remains **closed-source**, as we're still actively developing and stabilizing core systems. Because of this, **code-level contributions are not yet possible**. 
However, there are meaningful ways to support the project during its **Alpha** and **Beta** development phases.

## 🚧 Current Contribution Paths

Even without access to the source code, you can still contribute in **three key areas**:

### 1. 🧠 Improvement Proposals
Help shape the future of Esconde-esconde by submitting **feature suggestions**, **gameplay ideas**, or **quality-of-life improvements**. Your creativity and insight can directly influence the development roadmap.

➡️ [Submit an Improvement Proposal](https://forms.gle/A5vF9Sh1pyLb2P2J8)

### 2. 🐞 Bug Observation Reports (BOR)
Encountered a bug? Please let us know! Accurate and well-detailed **Bug Observation Reports** (BORs) are vital to improving stability and gameplay reliability.

## 🏆 Recognition Agreement

All contributors—whether you're suggesting improvements, submitting bugs, or creating maps—will be acknowledged as part of our **Recognition Agreement** during Alpha and Beta phases.  
Rewards and public recognition are part of our ongoing commitment to support and appreciate the community behind this project.

More details about this agreement can be found in the [README](/readme.md#recognition-agreement).

## 📖 When will code contributions be possible?

The plugin will be **fully open-sourced** once its core features are stable, documented, and ready for community maintenance. This includes:

- Game logic and mechanics  
- Plugin configurations  
- Map data and metadata  
- Tooling and development utilities  
- Official documentation

Once we reach that stage, this `contributing.md` will be **expanded** with full instructions on setting up the development environment, coding standards, testing guidelines, and pull request etiquette.

Thank you for helping shape Esconde-esconde!
